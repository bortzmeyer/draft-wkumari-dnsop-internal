    <abstract>
      <t>It has become clear that a number of users would like to use the DNS
      resolution system for "internal" names or names which do not have
      meaning in the global context. This document reserves the string
      ".internal" for this purpose. </t>

      <t>[ Ed note: This document is intended to drive discussion. It is clear
      that there has been a desire for an RFC1918-type TLD for a long time; in
      its absence, people have just started using whatever seemed convenient.
      This document (which may be controversial) requests that the allocation
      of .internal for this use. There is no existing process for this - some
      of the purpose of this document is to explore the process implications,
      etc. ] </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Over the years, a number of strings have been used as pseudo-TLDs for
      namespaces that disjoint from the "global" namespace - examples of these
      include .home, .corp, .mail. See <xref
      target="I-D.chapin-additional-reserved-tlds "/>, <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-sutld-ps"/> for more background information on
      this issue. The <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-sutld-ps"/> document
      discusses the issues in depth, and should be considered required reading
      for understanding this document. </t>

      <t>The <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-alt-tld"/> document reserves a
      string to be used as a pseudo-TLD for non-DNS resolution contexts.
      However, it is clear that there is a significant need for a similar
      string to be used for namespaces which are resolved using the DNS
      protocol but which do not have a meaning in the global context. </t>

      <t>There are no protocol police, and so there is no way to prevent users
      from simply picking a string (such as .home) and starting to use it for
      internal use. [ While it may be tempting to scold such users with a
      rolled up newspaper and shout "Bad user! Don't do that!", this is a: not
      really feasible and b: many times the users have a legitimate need for
      namespaces not connected to the global DNS. ] Unfortunately, while these
      strings are supposed to only be used internally, it is inevitable that
      they will leak into the global DNS.</t>

      <t>This document requests allocation of a string to be used as a
      pseudo-TLD for namespaces that are not part of the global DNS. A
      reasonable analogy is that this is to names as RFC1918 is to IP
      addresses. This should alleviate pollution, such as junk queries at the
      root, and potential collisions with other users of the namespace. </t>

      <t>[ Ed: Yes, I am well aware of the discussion of the .homenet
      delegation, and the resulting decision to *not* request that the IANA /
      ICANN / &lt;someone&gt; delegate the .homenet TLD for the IETF's use.
      There *are* significant similarities to the .homenet case, but also
      significant differences. These include (in no particular order) the fact
      that the use case is significant broader, and that there is no urgency
      to the request and does not delay or create uncertainty for any protocol
      work. No doubt there will be much discussion on the similarities,
      differences, precedent, etc. ] </t>

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Use cases">
      <t>The ".internal" TLD can be used for any purpose where a non-global
      DNS name is needed.</t>

      <t>This includes creating a namespace "behind" a Customer Premises
      Equipment (CPE) (for example, Belkin squatted on ".belkin" for this,
      British Telecom squatted on ".home", and shipped devices named
      "bthomehub.home" <xref target="BT_HOME_HUB"/>), as well as internal
      resolution systems like Microsoft Active Directory (at one time,
      documentation suggested that administrators use ".corp" for this). </t>

      <t>The .internal TLD is intended to address some of the issues
      documented in the Special-Use Domain Names Problem Statement <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-sutld-ps"/> specifically (from the list in
      Section 3):</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="5.3:">Intended use is covered by gTLD process, but the
          third party doesn't want to pay a fee.</t>

          <t hangText="5.4:">Intended use is covered by some IETF process, but
          the third party doesn't want to follow the process.</t>

          <t hangText="5.6:">Unaware that a name intended to be used only
          locally may nevertheless leak</t>

          <t hangText="5.7:">Unaware that a name used locally with informal
          allocation may subsequently be allocated formally, creating
          operational problems.</t>

          <t hangText="18">There exists no safe, non-process-violating
          mechanism for ad-hoc assignment of Special-Use Domain Names.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Other use cases for .internal include things like testing,
      prototyping and benchmarking - the author has often needed to setup a
      fake root and namespace in order to test something, and / or arbitrarily
      chosen a name for a piece of network equipment which it not connected to
      the Internet.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Why not use &lt;existing name&gt;?">
      <t>The IANA "Special Use Names" registry [TODO: Ref] already contains
      some names which, it could be argued, already meet this need.
      Unfortunately, many of these names are either reserved for a specific
      use case (e.g .example), or are semantically unsuitable (for example, a
      CPE manufacturer would likely not find "Open a browser and connect to
      'router.invalid'" acceptable).</t>

      <t>This section discusses why existing strings in the Special-Use Domain
      Names registry (<xref target="IANA.SUN"/>) are not appropriate.</t>

      <section title="Why not use .alt?">
        <t>The .alt presudo-TLD is specifically only for use as a pseudo-TLD
        for non-DNS resolution contexts. At one point .alt was being
        considered both for DNS and non-DNS resolution contexts, but, after
        much discussion it was decided that the DNSSEC implications (and
        desired behavior) meant that .alt should be reserved specifically for
        non-DNS resolution. </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Why not use something.arpa?">
        <t>This is indeed an interesting idea. I suspect that it fails the
        semantically desirable / understandable case, but is definitely worth
        discussing further. It may also cause issues when server operators
        override part of the .arpa domain in order to instantiate
        something.arpa.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Why not use .local?">
        <t>.local is already in wide use and has special handling implemented
        for handing .local names. See <xref target="RFC6762"/> Section 22.1
        Subsection 3, 4, 5.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Why not use .example?">
        <t>.example, .example.[com|net|org] may indeed be appropriate.
        Unfortunately, the hard part of all of this is not the selection and
        adding of a name to the "Special Use Names" registry, but rather a:
        deciding if this should be done, and b: process work to interact with
        ICANN in order to achieve the delegation. </t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="DNSSEC Considerations">
      <t>The .internal TLD would be an unsigned TLD, as there is no (clean)
      way to sign it.</t>

      <t>This particular topic received much discussion during the "Should
      .alt be used for DNS, or only non-DNS resolution" discussions, and was
      the cause of much confusion and misunderstandings. Much of this revolved
      around why it is important to have an insecure DNSSEC delegation for a
      name which is added to the Locally-Served DNS Zones <xref
      target="IANA.LocallyServed">(</xref> ) registry, or any other case where
      a name is instantiated. It is briefly covered here, but interested
      readers should review the DNSOP mailing lists for more details. </t>

      <t>Take the following figure:<figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
                +-----------+         +----------+
 .-------.      |           |         |   Stub   |

        </figure></t>

      <t>The user has just purchased a new CPE, which creates an internal
      namespace called .internal, and responds to lookups for router.interal
      with its (internal) management IP address (another example would be a
      corporate user at an organization which has created a private internal
      namespace disconnected from the public, global DNS). The CPE hands out
      addresses using DHCP, and lists itself as the DNS server.</t>

      <t>The user follows the instructions included in the box, and enters
      "http://router.internal" into a web browser. This causes a DNS lookup to
      be sent from the user's stub to the recursive resolver. The recursive
      resolver correctly identifies that this is query is for itself, and so
      responds with an answer saying "router.internal is 192.168.0.1". </t>

      <t/>

      <section title="Scenario 1 - No DNSSEC, .internal not delegated">
        <t>In this scenario, the .internal name has not been added to the
        root, and the user's stub resolver *does not* perform DNSSEC
        validation. The stub receives the response, performs no validation,
        and so trust the answer and connects. The user is happy. This is the
        current behavior for non-DNSSEC validating stubs.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Scenario 2 - DNSSEC, .internal not delegated">
        <t>In this scenario, the .internal name has not been added to the
        root, and the user's stub resolver *does* perform DNSSEC validation.
        The stub receives the response, and begins DNSSEC validation. As the
        .internal TLD has not been added to the root zone, DNSSEC
        Authenticated Denial of Existence proves that the .internal TLD does
        not exist (currently there is an NSEC record proving that nothing
        exists between .intel and .international). This results is a DNSSEC
        Bogus outcome, the user is unable to connect, and becomes frustrated.
        This is the current behavior for DNSSEC validating stubs.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Scenario 3 - DNSSEC, .internal delegated">
        <t>In this scenario, the .internal name has been added to the DNS
        root, with an insecure delegation to AS112 (by "insecure delegation"
        we mean that that there is no DS record for .internal in the root
        zone; the .internal domain is unsigned). The stub receives the
        response, and performs DNSSEC validation. As .internal has been
        delegated, there is an (insecure) entry in the root zone, proving that
        the .internal TLD exists. As it is an insecure delegation, the
        validating stub is perfectly happy to accept the "router.internal is
        192.168.0.1" response, the user connects to their router, and everyone
        is happy.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document requests that the .internal TLD be assigned to the IANA
      (like .example is) and a DNSSEC insecure delegation (no DS records) be
      inserted into the root-zone, delegated to blackhole-[12].iana.org [Ed:
      Oh, goody. We get to have the AS112 / DNAME / etc argument all over
      again! ] </t>

      <t>[Ed note: I fully understand that this is not something which the
      IANA has the authority to do - this was extensively discussed during the
      .homenet discussions. The text in the IANA considerations is basically a
      placeholder. If there is consensus that the reservation of .internal
      makes sense, there will need to be a significant amount of process
      design. It is likely that this will look something like the IESG asks
      the IAB to request ICANN to consider the reservation / delegation of
      this string. ICANN does not currently have a process for handling
      requests like these, and so will likely need to design a process for
      this. It is expected that this will all be a lengthy process; it is also
      entirely possible that this may not actually result in a delegation. ]
      </t>

      <section title="Domain Name Reservation Considerations">
        <t>[ Ed: This section is to satisfy the requirement in Section 5 of
        RFC6761. This document is intended to spark discussion, there is
        currently no process for the IETF / IAB to request that ICANN delegate
        a TLD for special use, and simply adding .internal to the "Special-Use
        Domain Name" registry (<xref target="IANA.SUN"/>) doesn't accomplish
        this. I have decided to fill in the RFC6761 "questions" simply to
        clarify the expected behavior. This entire section to be removed
        before publication. ]</t>

        <t>The string ".internal." is special in the following ways:<list
            style="numbers">
            <t>Users may know that strings that end in .internal behave
            differently to normal DNS names. They may expect that names of the
            form &lt;something&gt;.internal refer to resources internal to
            their network / enterprise / similar.</t>

            <t>Writers of application software not required to perform any
            special handing for .internal names. They are resolved normally,
            using the DNS.</t>

            <t>Writers of name resolution APIs and libraries are not expected
            to perform special handling.</t>

            <t>Caching DNS servers MAY recognize these names as special. By
            default they should answer them locally (using "Locally Served
            Zones"), but may be configured to forward them to authoritative
            servers.</t>

            <t>Authoritative DNS servers SHOULD NOT recognize these names as
            special and should not perform any special handling with them,
            unless they wish to instantiate an internal namespace, in which
            case they can choose to simply create any names within .internal
            that they want. Names are "local" to the network, and only have
            meaning within that network.</t>

            <t>DNS server operators SHOULD be aware that queries for names
            ending in .internal are not part of the global, IANA DNS, and were
            leaked into the global DNS. This information may be useful for
            support or debugging purposes.</t>

            <t>DNS Registries/Registrars MUST NOT grant requests to register
            ".internal" names in the normal way to any person or entity. These
            ".internal" names are defined by protocol specification to be
            nonexistent, and they fall outside the set of names available for
            allocation by registries/registrars.</t>
